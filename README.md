This repository uses the Kaggle data set for stock exchange prediction 


Success in any financial market requires one to identify solid investments. When a stock or derivative is undervalued, it makes sense to buy. If it's overvalued, perhaps it's time to sell. While these finance decisions were historically made manually by professionals, technology has ushered in new opportunities for retail investors. Data scientists, specifically, may be interested to explore quantitative trading, where decisions are executed programmatically based on predictions from trained models.


In this model we have used the kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/data .
For the user convince i will add the data set here .
